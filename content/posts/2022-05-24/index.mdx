Hello again,

My server is currently hosted on cloud with a simple block storage and cpu / ram combination. 
It gonna be hosted dedicated soon after I get myself a server (gotta import those shits) and a working port forwarding router (if only it wasn't for my home double NAT and its complexity of many cameras and stuffs) (lul).

TO DO list of things I want to do this year (2022) : 
  - Pass away, I mean pass the subject at school and my capstone project
  - Earn some moneys to pay for all my investment (which is pretty in a negative right now due to the world's inflation, covid and war)
  - Modifying some changes to the safe and the homepage of my sites.
  - Get a girl :cunny:
  - Get laid :fbi_open_up:
